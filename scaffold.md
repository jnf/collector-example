# -> Tell folks about the CFP
- on the home page? (root route)
- just has info about what and why (static view?)
  - I'll need a controller & a view

# Have a proposal workflow
- folks can fill out a form
- persist the form to the db
  - which means I prolly need a db
  - which means I prolly need a schema
  - which means I prolly need a migration
  - which means I prolly need a model or like an erd or something
- thank you page. :)

# Have a proposal review workflow
- a reviewer needs to see all the proposals
  - so that's prolly a list
- clik through to a detail page
- notes? <- I don't know if I can get to this today
